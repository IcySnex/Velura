*These Terms of Use/Privacy Policy (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Velura, which enables streaming of your personal media content from a local server (e.g. a NAS or SMB), on devices like iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.*

*Please read the Terms carefully. By using this app, you agree to the terms outlined below.*

# 1. Age Requirement
Velura is designed for users aged 13 and older.

# 2. Permissions and Data Access
To function, Velura requires limited permissions to access:
- Storage: For reading files from your device and save metadata or logs.
- Local Network: For connecting to and streaming media files.

Velura only accesses these permissions to provide core streaming functions and does not transmit data outside of your device or share it with third parties.

# 3. User Content and Ownership
Velura is designed to display users' personal media files, such as movies or TV shows stored on a local server. The content accessed via the app remains fully owned by the user.
Additionally, Velura may retrieve metadata like cover art and descriptions from trusted third-party services (e.g., IMDb) to enhance the user experience. Users are responsible for ensuring that any media streamed complies with applicable copyright and licensing laws.

# 4. Data Storage and Privacy
Velura does not collect or store any personal data or user information. All media content and associated metadata remain on your device or are stored in iCloud if you choose to sync data through Apple's iCloud services.
Velura has no access to, nor does it transmit or share, this data externally. By using the app, you acknowledge that Velura meets applicable data protection regulations, including GDPR, due to this local-only data approach.

# 5. In-App Purchases
While Velura is currently free to use, future updates may include optional paid features, such as one-time purchases or subscriptions, for enhanced functionality. These purchases are subject to Apple’s App Store policies, including its refund guidelines.

# 6. User Conduct
Users are expected to use Velura responsibly and lawfully. Any misuse, such as unauthorized redistribution of media, is strictly prohibited and is the user’s responsibility. Velura does not tolerate any behavior that violates applicable laws or these Terms.

# 7. Liability and Disclaimers
Velura is provided on an “as-is” basis without warranties of any kind. Although we strive for accuracy, we do not guarantee the completeness or reliability of metadata retrieved from third parties, nor the uninterrupted performance of the app.
We are not liable for any incidental, consequential, or indirect damages arising from your use or inability to use the app. Users agree to use Velura at their own risk.

# 8. Modifications to the App or Terms
Velura reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. We encourage you to review these Terms periodically. Continued use of the app after any updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

# 9. Governing Law
These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Germany. By using Velura, you consent to the jurisdiction of German courts for any legal disputes arising from or related to the app.
